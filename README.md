### Overview

Quick download:

    $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mzet-/linux-exploit-suggester/master/linux-exploit-suggester.sh -O les.sh

linux-exploit-suggester.sh was inspired by the excellent [Linux_Exploit_Suggester](https://github.com/PenturaLabs/Linux_Exploit_Suggester) script by [PenturaLabs](https://penturalabs.wordpress.com/). The issue with Pentura's script however is that it isn't up to date anymore (the script was last updated in early 2014) so it lacks some recent Linux kernel exploits. linux-exploit-suggester.sh on the other hand also contains all the latest (as of early 2018) publicly known Linux kernel exploits. It is also capable to identify possible privilege escalation vectors via installed userspace packages and comes with some additional minor features that makes finding right exploit more time efficient.

The purpose of this script is twofold:

 - maintaining up-to-date list of Linux privilege escalation exploits and essential info about it.
 - **assisting** security analyst in identifying local priv esc attack vectors on target Linux machine.

Example of script's output:

Here's the comparision between the linux-exploit-suggester.sh and [Linux_Exploit_Suggester](https://github.com/PenturaLabs/Linux_Exploit_Suggester) scripts:

- linux-exploit-suggester.sh aims to contain list of all publicly known Linux kernel exploits applicable for kernels 2.6 and up
- On debian-based & redhat-based distros linux-exploit-suggester.sh checks for privilege escalation vectors also via installed userspace packages by parsing `'dpkg -l'/'rpm -qa'` output and comparing it to contained list of publicly known privilege escalation exploits
- In linux-exploit-suggester.sh many exploits were tagged with the distribution name on which they have successfully run. This is an additional tip which is supposed to make chosing the right exploit for the target at hand easier and quicker. Tags comes from three main sources: exploit authors (they often indicate in exploit's source on which distro they have developed/run/tested the exploit); from exploit-db.com; and from my own testing. You are more than welcome to send me the info on which distro you have successfully run particular exploit to make exploit tagging more complete and more accurate
- linux-exploit-suggester.sh tries to be as compatible with Linux_Exploit_Suggester as possible. It uses the same exploits names, it supports `-k` flag and it has very similar output
- exploits that are aplicable solely for kernels 2.4.x were dropped from linux-exploit-suggester.sh - I believe that 2.4 kernels are so rare these days that there's no point in keeping them (if you don't agree and you work with this kernel line regularly during your pen testing engagements please let me know)
- exploits from Linux_Exploit_Suggester which have no download link (like: elfcd, kdump, local26, ong_bak, pwned, py2, etc.) were dropped from linux-exploit-suggester.sh because there's no point in keeping exploits with no source code available (if you have access to source code for these exploits please let me know)
- linux-exploit-suggester.sh has some additional minor features like `--fetch-sources` and `--fetch-binaries`
- linux-exploit-suggester.sh is written in Bash (and requires `Bash in ver. >= 4.0`) as opposed to Linux_Exploit_Suggester which was coded in perl

### Tips, limitations, caveats

 - Remember that this script is only meant to **assist** the analyst in his auditing activities. It won't do the all work for him!
 - That's the analyst job to determine whether given target at hand isn't patched against generated list of candidate exploits (the script doesn't look at distro patchlevel so obviously it won't do that for you)
 - In addition to manual inspection [Oracle's Ksplice Inspector](http://www.ksplice.com/inspector) could come handy with determining the previous one
 - Selected exploit almost certainly will need some customization to suit your target (at minimum: correct commit_creds/prepare_kernel_cred pointers) so knowledge about kernel exploitation techniques is needed

### Usage

```
Usage: linux-exploit-suggester.sh [OPTIONS]

 --version                    - print version of this script
 -h | --help                  - print this help
 -k | --kernel <version>      - provide kernel version
 -u | --uname <string>        - provide 'uname -a' string
 --skip-more-checks           - do not perform additional checks (kernel config, sysctl) to determine if exploit is applicable
 --skip-pkg-versions          - skip checking for exact userspace package version (helps to avoid false negatives)
 -p | --pkglist-file <file>   - provide file with 'dpkg -l' or 'rpm -qa' command output
 -s | --fetch-sources         - automatically downloads source for matched exploit
 -b | --fetch-binaries        - automatically downloads binary for matched exploit if available
 -f | --full                  - show full info about matched exploit
 -g | --grepable              - show grep friendly info about matched exploit
 --kernelspace-only           - show only kernel vulnerabilities
 --userspace-only             - show only userspace vulnerabilities
 -d | --show-dos              - show also exploitable vulns for which fully working exploit is not publicly available
```

**Running directly on tested machine**

Running directly on tested machine is suggested mode of operation for `linux-exploit-suggester.sh` as it additionally (to just comparing kernel versions) performs checks like: examines kernel CONFIG_*, checks sysctl entries or runs custom Bash commands to rule out exploits that are not applicable for a given machine. For example:

 - for `dccp` exploit script checks if kernel was build with `CONFIG_IP_DCCP` support,
 - for `af_packet` exploit script checks if kernel was build with `CONFIG_USER_NS` support and if sysctl entry `kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone` is enabled,
 - for `target_offset` exploit script checks if `ip_tables` modules is loaded (executing `grep -qi ip_tables /proc/modules` command),

and so on. Optionally those additional checks can by skipped by running with `--skip-more-checks` command line switch.

Additionally, in this mode `linux-exploit-suggester.sh` by default also fetches installed packages listing and checks for applicable user space exploits if distribution is one of: `Debian, Ubuntu, RHEL/CentOS`.

Default run on target machine (kernel version, packages versions and additional checks as described above are performed to give the list of possible exploits:

    $ ./linux-exploit-suggester.sh

As previously but only userspace exploits are checked:

    $ ./linux-exploit-suggester.sh --userspace-only

**Running with -k|--uname option**

Running with `-k` option is handy if one wants to quickly examine which exploits could be potentially applicable for given kernel version (this is also compatibility mode with Linux_Exploit_Suggester):

    $ ./linux-exploit-suggester.sh -k 3.1

With `--uname` one provides slightly more information (`uname -a` output from target machine) to `linux-exploit-suggester.sh` and receives slightly specific list of possible exploits (for example also target arch `x86|x86_64` is taken into account when generating exploits list):

    $ ./linux-exploit-suggester.sh --uname "Linux taris 3.16.0-30-generic #40~14.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Thu Jan 15 17:43:14 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux"

Optionally `--pkglist-file <file>` could be provided to `-k` or `--uname` to also check for user space exploits:

    (remote machine) $ dpkg -l > dpkgOutput.txt
    $ ./linux-exploit-suggester.sh --uname "Linux taris 3.16.0-30-generic #40~14.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Thu Jan 15 17:43:14 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux" --pkglist-file dpkgOutput.txt

In terms of generated list of exploits its identical with executing (directly on the given remote machine):

    (remote machine) $ ./linux-exploit-suggester.sh --skip-more-checks

**Examining only userspace exploits**

Sometimes it is handy to examine just package listing (in this case only check for userspace exploits is performed):

    (remote machine) $ dpkg -l > dpkgOutput.txt
    $ ./linux-exploit-suggester.sh --pkglist-file dpkgOutput.txt

**Other usages/options**

Kernel version number is taken from current OS, sources for possible exploits are downloaded to current directory (only kernel space exploits are examined):

    $ ./linux-exploit-suggester.sh --fetch-sources --kernelspace-only

Kernel version number is taken from command line, full details (like: kernel version requirements, comments and URL pointing to announcement/technical details about exploit) about matched exploits are listed:

    $ ./linux-exploit-suggester.sh -k 4.1 --full

Kernel version number is taken from current OS, binaries for applicable exploits are downloaded (if available) to current directory:

    $ ./linux-exploit-suggester.sh --fetch-binaries

Note however that `--fetch-binaries` is not recommended as it downloads binaries from generally not trusted sources and most likely these binaries weren't compiled for your target anyway. It should be used as a kind of last resort option when you're running out of time during your pen testing engagement and there is no compiler available on your target at hand.
